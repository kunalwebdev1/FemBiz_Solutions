        <h1>Details</h1>
        <p>
        Here are some common problems faced by women in entrepreneurship:
        <br>
        <br>

        1. Access to Funding: Women entrepreneurs often encounter challenges in accessing funding compared to their male counterparts. They may face bias from investors, resulting in lower funding amounts or fewer investment opportunities.
        <br>
        <br>
      
        2. Gender Bias and Discrimination: Gender bias and discrimination persist in the entrepreneurial ecosystem, affecting women's access to resources, opportunities, and support networks. Women may face stereotypes, prejudice, and unequal treatment in business settings.
        <br>
        <br>
      
        3. Limited Networking Opportunities: Women entrepreneurs may have fewer networking opportunities compared to men, which can impact their ability to build relationships, find mentors, and access valuable business connections. Male-dominated networks and events may further exacerbate this challenge.
        <br>
        <br>
      
        4. Work-Life Balance: Balancing entrepreneurship with family responsibilities and personal commitments can be challenging for women, especially those with caregiving responsibilities. The pressure to juggle multiple roles can lead to burnout and impact their ability to focus on growing their businesses.
        <br>
        <br>
      
        5. Lack of Role Models and Representation: The lack of visible role models and representation of women in leadership positions and successful entrepreneurial ventures can hinder aspiring women entrepreneurs' confidence and aspirations. The absence of relatable success stories may limit their belief in their own potential.
        <br>
        <br>  

        6. Access to Mentorship and Support: Women entrepreneurs may face difficulties in finding mentors and support networks tailored to their needs and experiences. They may lack access to guidance, advice, and mentorship opportunities from successful female entrepreneurs or industry leaders.
        <br>
        <br>

        7. Unequal Access to Resources: Women entrepreneurs may encounter barriers in accessing essential resources such as business networks, educational programs, incubators, and accelerators. Unequal access to resources can hinder their ability to scale their ventures and compete in the marketplace.
        <br>
        <br>

        8. Risk Aversion and Perceived Competence: Women may face societal pressure to conform to traditional gender roles, leading to risk aversion and reluctance to take entrepreneurial risks. Additionally, they may experience doubts about their competence and abilities due to societal expectations and stereotypes.
        <br>
        <br>

        9. Unconscious Bias in Business Interactions: Women entrepreneurs may encounter unconscious bias in business interactions, including meetings, negotiations, and client interactions. Stereotypes about women's capabilities and leadership abilities may influence perceptions and decision-making processes.
          <br>
          <br>

        10. Access to Affordable Childcare: Childcare responsibilities can pose significant challenges for women entrepreneurs, especially those with young children. Limited access to affordable childcare options may constrain their ability to dedicate time and energy to their businesses.
